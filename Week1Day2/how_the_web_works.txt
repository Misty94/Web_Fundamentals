The Request Response Cycle:

1. Client makes a request such as "http://www.amazon.com"
2. Client gets back a response from the server (the computer that amazon owns that has all their web pages). The response is a web page.
3. The response consists of: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


HTML - The content of the web page (text, images, form inputs, form dropdowns, checkboxes, radion buttons, buttons, links)

CSS - The styling of the content and the arranging of the content (make the background color blue, change font color and font style, place some content next to other content)

JS - The manipulation of the content and styling based on user events (clicking, scrolling, hovering the mouse). For example, if I click on something, more content appears. Based on the user interaction, it changes the appearance of the page.
